# Deep Machine - JavaScript Quiz

Welcome to the Deep Machine JavaScript Quiz repo! I made the Deep Machine as a challenge task in my bootcamp. It features HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I hope you enjoy the quiz as it was a very challenging project to complete for me. I made a few wireframes to help me pseudo code and get the right JavaScript logic. Here is the initial page in all its glory!!
